    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Overfitting\n",
      "\n",
      "**What it is:** Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data *too well*. It becomes so specialized in recognizing the patterns and even the noise within the training set that it struggles to generalize to new, unseen data. Think of it like a student who memorizes every single answer to a practice test but doesn't truly understand the underlying concepts. When faced with a slightly different exam, they'll perform poorly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key characteristics of an overfit model:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **High accuracy on training data:** The model performs exceptionally well on the data it was trained on.\n",
      "*   **Low accuracy on testing/validation data:** The model performs poorly on data it has never seen before.\n",
      "*   **Complex model:** Often, overfit models are overly complex, with too many parameters or too many features being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simple Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're trying to build a model to predict whether a student will pass an exam based on the number of hours they studied.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Training Data:** You have a small dataset of 10 students. One student studied 2 hours and failed, another studied 3 hours and failed, another studied 4 hours and passed, and so on.\n",
      "*   **Overfit Model:** You build a very complex model (e.g., a high-degree polynomial regression) that perfectly fits every single data point in your training set. It might create a wiggly line that goes through every single \"pass\" and \"fail\" point exactly.\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** Now, you get a new student who studied 3.5 hours. Your overfit model, due to its extreme complexity and sensitivity to the training data, might predict they will fail because the wiggly line dips down at that exact point, even though in reality, studying 3.5 hours might lead to a pass. The model has learned the \"noise\" (minor variations) in the training data rather than the general trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Underfitting\n",
      "\n",
      "**What it is:** Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. It hasn't learned enough from the data to make accurate predictions, even on the training set itself. Think of it like a student who only reads the chapter titles of a textbook and then tries to answer exam questions. They lack the necessary knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key characteristics of an underfit model:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Low accuracy on training data:** The model performs poorly even on the data it was trained on.\n",
      "*   **Low accuracy on testing/validation data:** The model also performs poorly on new data.\n",
      "*   **Simple model:** Underfit models are often too simple, with too few parameters or features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simple Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's use the same student exam prediction scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Training Data:** The same 10 students with their study hours and pass/fail results.\n",
      "*   **Underfit Model:** You decide to use a very simple model, like a straight horizontal line that represents the average outcome (e.g., predicting \"fail\" for everyone, or predicting \"pass\" for everyone, or predicting based on a very basic threshold that doesn't capture the nuances). This line doesn't account for the fact that more study hours generally lead to a higher chance of passing.\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** This simple model will likely misclassify many students in your training data. For example, a student who studied 8 hours and passed would be predicted to fail by a model that just predicts \"fail\" for everyone. When you introduce a new student, the model's predictions will also be inaccurate because it hasn't learned the relationship between study hours and passing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Goal: A Well-Fitting Model\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal scenario is a **well-fitting model**. This model is complex enough to capture the important patterns in the data but not so complex that it starts memorizing noise. It generalizes well to new, unseen data, leading to good performance on both training and testing sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Overfitting:** Model is too complex, learns noise.\n",
      "*   **Underfitting:** Model is too simple, misses patterns.\n",
      "*   **Well-fitting:** Model strikes a balance, learns generalizable patterns.\n",

      "Of course! This is a fundamental concept in machine learning. Let's break it down using a simple analogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you are a student studying for a math exam. The \"training data\" is your set of practice problems with solutions. The final exam is the \"new, unseen data\" that will test how well you've actually learned the concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Underfitting** is like not studying enough.\n",
      "*   **Overfitting** is like memorizing the practice problems instead of learning the concepts.\n",
      "*   A **Good Fit** is like understanding the underlying concepts, allowing you to solve both the practice problems and new problems on the final exam.\n",

      "### 1. Underfitting (High Bias)\n",
      "\n",
      "**What it is:** Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is **too simple** to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It fails to learn the relationships between the input and output variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it as trying to draw a straight line through a set of points that clearly form a curve. The line is a poor representation of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The result:** The model performs poorly on **both** the training data and new, unseen data. It's just not a good model.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Student Analogy:** You glance at the practice problems for 10 minutes. You don't learn the formulas or the methods. You do poorly on the practice problems and, unsurprisingly, you fail the final exam. Your approach was too simplistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Simple Example: Predicting House Prices\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you have data on house prices. The price depends on the size (square feet). The data looks like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data:** The points show that as the size of a house increases, its price increases, but the relationship isn't a perfect straight line (it might curve upwards).\n",
      "*   **Underfit Model:** You try to model this with a simple straight line (a linear model).\n",
      "*   **Problem:** The straight line can't capture the curve in the data. It will make significant errors for both very small and very large houses. It's too simple and has **high bias** (it's biased towards being a straight line).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Overfitting (High Variance)\n",
      "\n",
      "**What it is:** Overfitting is the opposite problem. The model is **too complex** and learns the training data too well. It doesn't just learn the underlying patterns; it also learns the random noise and outliers specific to the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it as \"connecting the dots\" perfectly on a chart. The resulting line will be incredibly jagged and specific to those exact dots, but it won't represent the general trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The result:** The model performs exceptionally well on the training data (because it has essentially memorized it) but performs very poorly on new, unseen data. It cannot generalize.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Student Analogy:** You don't just study the practice problems—you memorize the exact questions and their specific answers. If you see those exact questions again, you'll get 100%. But the moment the final exam asks a slightly different question that uses the same concepts, you're lost because you never learned the underlying method.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Simple Example: Predicting House Prices (Again)\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data:** The same points as before.\n",
      "*   **Overfit Model:** You use an extremely complex model (e.g., a high-degree polynomial) that creates a squiggly line passing through every single data point perfectly.\n",
      "*   **Problem:** The model has learned the noise. If a new house (the orange dot) comes along, the model's prediction is likely to be wildly inaccurate because the squiggly line is too tailored to the original data. The model has **high variance** (it would change dramatically if you used a different set of training data).\n",

    "#### 1. Same model (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)\n",
    "The flash-lite model gave a short and direct explanation.  \n",
    "Its style was concise and focused on definitions.  \n",
    "From the logs, the number of output tokens was relatively small, meaning the model produces faster and shorter answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Different model (gemini-2.5-pro)\n",
    "The pro model produced a longer and more detailed explanation.  \n",
    "It added more examples, explanations, and clearer reasoning.  \n",
    "The logs showed more output tokens, which means it generates richer content.  \n",
    "This model is more “academic” and more descriptive.\n",

    "| Model | Output Style | Level of Detail | Token Usage |\n",
    "|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **flash-lite** | Short, direct | Basic explanation | Low |\n",
    "| **pro** | Longer, more structured | Deeper explanation | Higher |\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that **flash-lite is optimized for speed**, while **pro is optimized for high-quality reasoning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Effect of changing the system prompt\n",
    "When I changed the system prompt to a “friendly tutor” style:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The explanation became simpler and more conversational.\n",
    "- Sentences were shorter and easier to read.\n",
    "- The tone felt more casual and supportive.\n",

    "This shows that **the system prompt controls the model’s personality**, not the factual content.  \n",
    "Even with the same model, the output tone changed significantly.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

    "We can see that even with Gemini's embeddings there doesn't seem to be a clear 2D separation of clusters with our data classes. It could be because emotions are often not discrete. Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "- Some regions still contain a mix of multiple colors (emotions) just like in 2D.\n",

    "**Differences compared with the 2D graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 3D, when I rotate the plot, I can sometimes see small groups of points of the\n",
    "  same emotion that look a bit more compact than in 2D (for example, some `joy`\n",
    "  or `sadness` points form mini-clusters).\n",
    "- The extra dimension gives more “space”, so some overlaps that looked heavy in\n",
    "  2D become slightly less severe from certain viewing angles.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
